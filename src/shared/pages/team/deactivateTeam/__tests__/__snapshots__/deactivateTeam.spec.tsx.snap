          You are deactivating the 
          <strong>
            __TeamId__
          </strong>
           team.

          New cases wonâ€™t be assigned to it, but existing cases are unaffected
        </p>
        <p>
          This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            cases already with this team will stay with the team
          </li>
          <li>
            existing cases with this team can still be worked
          </li>
          <li>
            this team's topics will remain active but without a recommended team
          </li>
          <li>
            the team will no longer appear in drop-downs
          </li>
          <li>
            caseworkers will be prevented from giving new cases to the team
          </li>
          <li>
            in-flight cases that passed through this team can still be returned to it
          </li>
          <li>
            caseworkers will remain part of the team
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In an emergency, cases might be routed to the DCU central team.

          You can reactivate at any time.
